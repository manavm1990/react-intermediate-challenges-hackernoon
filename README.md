# Mid-React Challenge Add and Remove Items from a List

> This challenge is perhaps the most commonly asked React coding challenge for mid-level React developers.
> In this challenge, the developer has to create an input field with a button.
> When the button is clicked, the text in the input field should be added below in a list. Moreover, whenever any list item is clicked, it should be removed from the list.
> The motive of this challenge is to check how good the developer is with forms, state, and lists.
